# TypingRealm

This project is the game where you need to type with your keyboard.

## Goals

The goal is to create a game that will be suitable for the following:

- training tool for learning touch typing
- multiplayer support to compete in typing skill

### Training tool

The difficulty of the game should be adaptable for the skill of the player. The
game should contain training elements that can facilitate learning touch typing.

### Multiplayer support

The game should contain multiplayer support so many people can compete against
each other.

## Design

The decision was made to make the game multiplayer-first and add support for
single player later on.
